Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This website is about trading or exchanging video games and the things related to gaming (e.g. consoles).

index.html contains all of the things on the landing page like navbar, left navbar,  main body that includes all of  the ads and a search box. If you click on one of  the ads the ad.html file will open. It contains the ad's image and description. There is a button on the right side of the navbar  that is linked to the publish-ad.html. You can publish your ad in this page. First you have to choose which category your ad is about and then you can write a description about your ad, add an image, choose your state and ... . There are two links in the navbar. One of  them is my ads that will take you to the my-ads.html page you can see the ads that you have publish and if you haven't signed in yet there is a sign in button.This page has three tabs(my-ads, history and saved ads) that each one of them takes you to another page. The other link in the navbar will take you to the chat part where you can chat with someone who wants to purchase one of your ads or you can contact with the other as a purchaser. But it isn't compeleted and I will add it as a new feature when my website is finished. You might have noticed that there is a nav on the left side of the page.This nav is for filtering and it has two parts. The first one is the category part and you can filter the ads by their category.The next part is about filtering by price, image and the ads that their publishers are in a hurry to sell their things.

The website is compeletely responsive and if you inspect it on the small size devices you can see that the left nav will be converted to two buttons.And the other pages would change their size automatically.

Thanks for your time and consideration.
